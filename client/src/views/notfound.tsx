      Right now the preferred format is like
        <pre>alice.commits.to/do_the_thing</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please avoid any other special characters right now.
      Things are a bit in flux with the URL format!
      And there are a couple special characters that will cause things to break horribly.
    </p>
